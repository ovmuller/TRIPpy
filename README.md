Welcome to the TRIPpy wiki!

## 1.1 Brief description

This wiki documents the TRIPpy model. TRIPpy stands for Total Runoff Integrating Pathways in python. TRIPpy is a standalone implementation of the TRIP model, originally developed by [Oki and Sud (1998)](https://doi.org/10.1175/1087-3562(1998)002<0001:DOTRIP>2.3.CO;2) in Fortran. This implementation is developed and maintained by [Omar V. Müller](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Omar-Mueller). For help and/or contributions contact him at [ovmuller@gmail.com](mailto:ovmuller@gmail.com).

TRIPpy is a river routing model that collects the runoff from each grid cell in a given domain and drives it through a prescribed river network, estimating the river storage and outflow of each grid cell. TRIPpy uses a simple advection method to route total runoff through the topography. Full description of the equations is provided in the appendix of [Müller et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0290.1). 

The main feature of TRIPpy is its simplicity, allowing long-term simulations in short time. It requires just one forcing variable (total runoff) and a few parameters: flow direction, flow sequence, and the calibratable parameters flow velocity and meandering ratio. Another important feature of the model is that TRIPpy does not consider any loss or gain of water, it just translates runoff values into river discharge. This feature allows (1) a comparison of simulated river discharge against observations, and thereby, a validation of runoff at catchment scale, and (2) offline simulations of rivers, conserving the water balance at the catchment scale when the forcing is generated by a GCM, a RCM, a LSM, or a reanalysis.
